## 💻 What I Do

I’m currently a software engineer at **Sigma Technology**. My main focus is on backend and system-level development – often diving into projects using C, Python, and whatever else gets the job done.
Previously, I worked at **Continental Automotive Hungary** as a Sr. Software Engineer, coding in C and contributing to automotive projects. My background also includes experiences outside the tech bubble, which taught me a lot about the real value of “white-collar” work.

## 📚 How I Learned

I’m mostly **self-taught**. Since I was a kid, I’ve always wanted to know how things work, tearing them apart and putting them back together (sometimes successfully!). I did start university after high school, but felt the academic system didn’t suit the way I learn best – so I took a different path and never looked back.

## 🔧 What I Tinker With

Outside of work, I love tinkering with my homelab – experimenting with things like TrueNAS SCALE, custom Docker/WordPress setups, YAML configs, and automation scripts. I enjoy building side projects for friends in **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. If there’s a tech puzzle, I’m probably on it.

## 💖 What I Love

I’m passionate about mountain biking (see my rides on Pinkbike), making videos and photos of my rides, and writing the occasional poem.
I also enjoy meeting new people and swapping stories – tech or otherwise!

## 🌍 Where I'm From

I grew up in Veszprém, **Hungary**, attended local schools, and have mostly stayed close to home. These days, I’m living in Hajmáskér – a quiet place that I really enjoy for its peaceful vibes.
