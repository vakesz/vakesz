![Profile](/img/profile.webp#center)

I’m a software engineer at **Sigma Technology**, currently developing backend systems and developer tooling. My journey has taken me from tinkering with old computers as a kid, through years of hands-on experience at Continental Automotive, to building robust systems and developer tooling in consulting roles. I’m self-taught, driven by curiosity, and always eager to learn how things work under the hood. When I’m not elbow‑deep in code, you’ll find me writing about something that's on my mind, tweaking my homelab, or having a good bike ride in the hills.

## My Story

I grew up in Veszprém, Hungary, and have always been fascinated by technology. My earliest memories involve taking apart old, barely-working computers and figuring out how to get them running again. This hands-on curiosity led me to programming in school, and eventually to a role at Continental Automotive, where I spent six years learning the ins and outs of large-scale automotive software projects.

At Continental, I started with unit testing and gradually moved into more complex development, working on millions of lines of code and collaborating with international teams. I was lucky to have mentors who challenged me to think deeper and solve problems independently. Their guidance shaped my approach to both engineering and teamwork. Despite the stability and great colleagues, I eventually felt the need for more autonomy and variety. The corporate environment became limiting, and I wanted to have a more direct impact on projects and outcomes. This led me to Sigma Technology, where I now enjoy a more flexible, supportive culture and the chance to work on a wider range of challenges.

## Philosophy

> “Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House

I believe great software strikes the sweet spot between **clarity**, **speed**, and **community**. That means:

- {{< fa eye >}} **Readable first, clever second.** Future‑you (and your teammates) will thank you.
- {{< fa chart-line >}} **Benchmarks over hunches.** Let data guide the next optimisation.
- {{< fa people-group >}} **Give back.** Whether that’s OSS PRs, mentoring juniors, or sharing hard‑won lessons on this blog.

## Beyond the Terminal

When screens go dark you’ll usually catch me:

- {{< fa gamepad >}} *Fragging out* in Counter-Strike (15k+ on a good day)
- {{< fa mountain >}} Leading mountain biking trips around the Wexl Trails
- {{< fa camera-retro >}} Capturing moments of my life on my phone, hopefully later with a Sony Alpha camera
