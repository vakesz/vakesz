As you might already know from the [About Me](/about) page, my name is Gabor Pinkova. These days, I work at Sigma Technology, but it’s been quite a journey to get here. My fascination with technology started young - growing up, I was lucky (and unlucky) enough to have access to a bunch of old, barely-working computers with no internet connection. I still have some of those relics stored away, and you can see them in the pictures below.

About the name “vakesz”: Honestly, I can’t remember exactly where it came from. I was sometimes called “vaksi” as a kid, and maybe I just morphed it into something that sounded cooler.

When I was young, I started learning programming at school. Breaking down big ideas into smaller, solvable parts really hooked me. Later, I tried university, but it felt monotonous and uninspiring - I just wasn’t learning anything that excited me. After about a year and a half, I dropped out with zero regrets. At the time, I didn’t realize how that choice might come back to haunt me.

I spent around six years at Continental Automotive, learning a lot and developing as a professional. Looking back, one of the things I’m most grateful for during those years was having amazing mentors like Zoltan P. and Attila H. They had a big impact on both my technical skills and my approach to solving problems. Instead of simply giving me answers, they challenged me to think deeper and discover solutions on my own.

What made them truly great mentors was their patience and their trust in my potential. Even if they seemed a bit “lazy” sometimes (in the sense of making me do the real digging), it pushed me to get comfortable with figuring out things independently. They didn’t micromanage or spoon-feed me, but rather pointed me in the right direction, encouraged my curiosity, and made it clear that it was okay to fail and try again. Over time, this guidance helped me grow not just as an engineer, but as a person who’s willing to face challenges head-on and keep improving. The confidence and practical problem-solving mindset I have today are thanks in large part to their influence and support. I genuinely believe that without their mentorship, I wouldn’t have achieved many of my personal and career goals.

But as time went on, especially towards the end of my stay, I noticed my motivation slipping. Projects started to feel repetitive, and the general atmosphere sometimes made it hard to stay enthusiastic. It became clear that I needed a change.

Transitioning to Sigma Technology wasn’t easy at first - I found it tough to break out of old habits and ways of thinking. But I can gladly say that the difference in environment has been huge. The culture here is much more friendly and welcoming, and it honestly feels like people are here to help each other rather than just put up roadblocks. That support and openness have made it a lot easier to rediscover my motivation, and working on exciting telecommunications and AI projects has only added to that renewed energy.

Why did I say that leaving university might come back to bite me? At Continental, my official title was SW Technician - even though I did engineering work - because HR required a degree for the Engineer title. This lack of a diploma made things difficult and often frustrating, especially when recruiters would reach out with engineering opportunities based on my experience, but official policies held me back from advancement.

Thankfully, this is no longer the case since moving to Sigma Technology. Here, I genuinely feel treated as an equal - my skills, ideas, and contributions are valued just as much as anyone else’s, regardless of my academic background. It’s refreshing and motivating to finally work in an environment where I’m seen for what I can actually do, and not just for a piece of paper. It really makes all the difference.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about mountain biking. I didn’t get to ride as much this year as I wanted, but I’m determined to make up for it next year. I also spend a lot of my free time tinkering with my homelab - experimenting with servers, Docker containers, custom YAML configs, and pretty much anything that lets me automate or optimize my setup at home. I really enjoy the challenge of breaking and fixing things, and learning along the way.

When I’m not on the trails or in the server room, you’ll probably find me playing a few rounds of CS to unwind, or working on a coding side project just for fun (or sometimes just to see if I can break something in a new way). I’ve always enjoyed the process of figuring things out - whether it’s software, hardware, or even just trying to automate something ridiculous.

Here’s a video from one of my favorite mountain biking spots - hope you enjoy it!
