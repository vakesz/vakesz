## Introduction

I've mostly worked in places unrelated to software engineering. Without a degree, I often felt I had no way to prove myself. Then one day I met someone who changed everything: Roland B., a senior engineer at Continental at the time. He saw potential in me - partly motivated by the referral bonus he’d get if I was hired - but more importantly, he took the time to share knowledge and guide me through the complexities of automotive software development. His mentorship was invaluable and opened doors I never imagined. It took me a while to grasp the full impact of his support, but it was a true turning point in my career. Looking back, it's still surprising that we met by chance while cycling with friends. Roland was an experienced and talented rider as well - and that our conversations ranged from bikes to my career path.

## The Continental Years

Starting at Continental, I was nervous. Without formal software education and surrounded by experienced colleagues with degrees, I felt out of place. But the team was welcoming and supportive. Early on, I was mostly writing unit tests for a BMW project - a task I found repetitive but useful for understanding the codebase. I got familiar with the tools and processes in the automotive industry, which were different from what I knew. Though I’d used Git before, they initially relied on older IBM tools that felt clunky, but thankfully switched to Git later.

As time passed, I worked on more complex features, implemented new functionalities, and fixed bugs. My testing experience helped me break down tasks into manageable parts, but the massive codebase (millions of lines) was daunting. I often hesitated to ask questions, fearing it might show my lack of competence. One colleague who sat next to me seemed "lazy" at first, often staring at bottles of whisky or playing Steam games. Yet, many turned to him for help - he was very experienced. I was shy to ask him for assistance, and when I did, his advice was usually a challenge rather than direct answers: "Try poking around the code. Look at these parts." Initially frustrating, I later realized he was teaching me to find solutions independently. This approach made me more resourceful and confident - a lesson I tried to pass on when mentoring others. Occasionally, seeing my struggle, he’d step in with guidance, but mostly, he let me figure things out, which I now recognize as one of the best gifts I received.

After my first year, I felt more confident and started handling tasks independently. I took on more responsibility and built stronger relationships with colleagues, which helped me feel part of the team. Around this time, I began working on a new project using a new technology stack I hadn't seen before. It also introduced a new language - CIDL (Component Interface Definition Language) used to define interfaces between components. Excited by the challenge, I immersed myself in learning the language and tools, even exploring system and network protocols beyond our codebase. I gained deep insight into the Run-Time Environment (RTE) and how system components interacted.

Several years later, I was fully independent and more vocal in meetings, sharing ideas and feedback. I started mentoring new team members, though I struggled to balance guiding them with letting them learn independently. I also took on generic system development - a role different from my previous work. It offered more freedom and less oversight, which helped me develop skills in managing my time, prioritizing tasks, and communicating effectively. I met many competent new people, and colleagues were often surprised by how well-connected I was internationally. If there was an issue on a customer project, I could usually reach out to a system developer abroad to get a fresh perspective. This sense of community and mutual support was one of the best aspects of working at Continental.

I built a good reputation and contributed meaningfully to projects, learning a lot about automotive software development and the industry. I believe I made a real impact and helped many colleagues along the way.

### The Shift in Motivation

Over time, however, the community spirit began to fade. Many experienced colleagues left, including Marc H., a close friend who shared insights about the company's direction. His departure was hard to witness and marked a shift for me. Though others left before, losing these connections made it harder to get help when needed. I still felt comfortable financially and professionally but increasingly found myself going through the motions. Projects became repetitive, and the atmosphere stifling. I woke up, went to work, completed tasks, went home, and repeated - without feeling challenged or growing.

I began searching for new opportunities, updating my CV and LinkedIn. I applied to several places, but many sought candidates with degrees or specific experience I lacked. One German company seemed promising, I succeeded in interviews and was offered financial support to relocate - but during the final discussion with the team manager, I felt looked down upon. It was uncomfortable, and though I stayed quiet hoping for the best, I ultimately didn't get the job. In hindsight, that was for the best.

Later, a recruiter reached out about a position at Sigma Technology. Initially hesitant, I decided to try. The interview process was refreshingly conversational rather than an interrogation. I could be myself and showcase my skills without judgment for my lack of a degree. The people were friendly and welcoming, and I sensed I could fit well with the team.

### Thoughts on Management and Leadership

One of the biggest lessons from Continental was about management styles. I saw good and bad examples. The best managers lead by example, aren't afraid to get their hands dirty, listen to their teams, and take feedback seriously. Trusting team members and granting autonomy boosts morale and productivity, while micromanagement harms both. Unfortunately, many Hungarian projects suffered from micromanagement, which hurt motivation and performance. On a few occasions, loud yelling in the office was unprofessional and demoralizing.

The office environment itself was challenging: open-plan spaces with high noise levels made concentration difficult. We gave feedback about the echo and distractions, but little changed. One positive shift was the COVID-19 pandemic enabling remote work. Before, working from home was limited to a few days a month. but during the pandemic we switched fully remote. Though it brought new challenges like managing time and disconnecting after hours, it was a welcome change. Returning to the office afterwards was disappointing, with stricter rules on presence and long mandatory office days even when no meetings were scheduled, which felt unnecessarily rigid.

On the bright side, I met some wonderful people, including Florian and Silvia who were software project managers eager to understand the technical side and support developers. They genuinely cared about our well-being, encouraged ownership, and trusted us to make decisions. I consider them among the best managers I had. One vivid memory: during a customer meeting, developers were asked for delivery dates, which felt inappropriate. I messaged Silvia, who promptly joined the meeting and clarified to the customer that delivery dates are handled by project managers, protecting the developers from unrealistic demands. This was a powerful example of effective leadership - having someone who advocates for their team is invaluable.

Though I encountered poor managers, the positive ones made a lasting impact. Recognizing and learning from good leadership is crucial.

## Making the Move to Sigma Technology

If I recall correctly, the first round was a casual chat with a recruiter where we discussed my background, what Sigma is like, and what to expect in the upcoming rounds. The next step was a timed technical challenge, similar to LeetCode or HackerRank. I was nervous but managed to solve the problems within the time limit. Shortly after, I had another conversation with the recruiter, who shared more details about the offer and explained there would be one final round with the team manager.

That final interview made me much more anxious, and unfortunately, it didn’t go as well as I’d hoped. Many of the questions focused on Linux and C++ topics I wasn’t prepared for, and I struggled to provide answers. I felt disappointed, but the recruiter reassured me that even if I didn’t pass this round, they still wanted to offer me a position, on a different team. That was a relief, but I was also a little uncertain about what this would mean for my future at Sigma.

## Current Reflections

Looking back on my journey, from where I started to where I am now, I’m amazed at how much I’ve grown. Along the way, many people have helped me, both personally and professionally. I even referred a friend to Sigma who is now thriving in their role, and I hope his experience will be as rewarding as mine.

So far, I’ve felt welcomed and supported, and I’m excited about the challenges ahead. I hope to regain the passion and momentum I had when I first started my previous job, as I lost some of that drive over time and am eager to find it again.

One important lesson I want to share is this: don’t be afraid to ask questions. Sometimes people may seem tough or unapproachable on the outside, but we’re all in the same boat, working toward shared goals. Asking questions is part of learning and growing, and it’s okay to seek help along the way.

I look forward to continuing to learn, grow, and contribute positively in my new role.

**Special Thanks**: to everyone who played a part in my journey - whether I’ve mentioned you by name or not - thank you. Your support, guidance, and friendship have been invaluable, and I am truly grateful to each of you.
