## The Non-Traditional Path

My journey from [previous background] to software engineering without a CS degree...

## The Self-Taught Mindset

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Learning to learn independently
- Building knowledge bottom-up vs top-down
- Comfort with uncertainty and gaps

### Practical Focus
- Building things that work vs theoretical perfection
- Real-world constraints drive decisions
- Learning what you need when you need it

## Advantages in the Workplace

### Adaptability
- Used to figuring things out independently
- Less attached to "the right way"
- Comfortable with diverse technologies

### Business Perspective
- Understanding the "why" behind technical decisions
- Pragmatic approach to trade-offs
- Focus on solving actual problems

## The Challenges

### Impostor Syndrome
- Feeling like you don't belong
- Comparing your knowledge to CS graduates
- Missing foundational concepts

### Communication Gaps
- Different vocabulary and mental models
- Explaining intuitive knowledge
- Bridging theory and practice

## What I Learned at Continental

- How formal processes complement intuitive problem-solving
- The value of mentors like Zoltan P. and Attila H.
- When academic knowledge really matters

## Advice for Other Self-Taught Developers

### Filling the Gaps
- Strategic learning of computer science fundamentals
- Understanding when theory matters
- Building a personal curriculum

### Finding Your Tribe
- Connecting with other self-taught developers
- Finding mentors who appreciate different backgrounds
- Contributing your unique perspective

## The Future of Development

Why diverse educational backgrounds make teams stronger...

## Conclusion

Being self-taught isn't a limitationâ€”it's a different kind of strength...
