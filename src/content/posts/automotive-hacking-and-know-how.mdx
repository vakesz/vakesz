I've been listening to [Hack és Lángos](https://hackeslangos.show/) for years. They go deep on in-vehicle networks, what you can observe and modify in a car, and why security matters. Hungarian-only, but worth the time if you follow.

## Core automotive protocols

| Protocol                                        | Purpose & key traits                                                                      | Status in 2025                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **CAN 2.0**                                     | 1 Mbit/s arbitration-based bus for control messages. Cheap, ubiquitous, 8-byte payload.   | Everywhere for body/chassis control.            |
| **CAN-FD**                                      | Extends CAN to 64-byte payloads and up to 8 Mbit/s in the data phase.                     | Shipping on nearly every new model since ~2021. |
| **LIN**                                         | Low-cost single-wire bus (19.2 kbit/s) for simple actuators (mirrors, seats, HVAC flaps). | Mature, still growing.                          |
| **FlexRay**                                     | 10 Mbit/s dual-channel, time-triggered, fault-tolerant.                                   | Niche; being replaced by Ethernet.              |
| **Automotive Ethernet (100/1000BASE-T1 + TSN)** | Switched network for ADAS, infotainment, OTA updates.                                     | Standard for domain/zonal backbones since 2023. |
| **SOME/IP**                                     | Service-oriented middleware over Ethernet (often with DoIP).                              | OEM-agnostic standard for ADAS & infotainment.  |
| **DoIP**                                        | UDS diagnostics over TCP/UDP instead of CAN.                                              | Mandatory under EU Regulation 2018/858.         |

> There are more protocols in use - this is just the subset I've worked with and a starting point if you want to dig deeper.

## Getting your first traces

1. **Start with the OBD-II port** (standard 16-pin J1962 connector).
   - Cheap ELM327-compatible dongles work for basic UDS/OBD requests.
   - For raw logging, use a real sniffer: _CandleLight_, _CANtact Pro_, _ValueCAN 4_.

2. **Understand the gateway.** Most vehicles only route diagnostic frames to OBD. To see the rest:
   - Locate the gateway ECU in the wiring diagram.
   - Back-probe the high-speed CAN bus, or build a bench harness with the target ECUs plus a lab supply (12 V and 5 V rails).

3. **Pick your tooling.**
   - Commercial: Vector CANalyzer/CANoe, Intrepid Vehicle Spy.
   - Open-source: Wireshark (with `socketcan`), SavvyCAN, Kayak, cabana (Comma.ai).
   - On Linux: `ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000` is your friend.

4. **Decode the data.** Without a DBC file, frames are just IDs and payloads. Public options:
   - [OpenDBC](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc) - crowd-sourced DBCs for 150+ models.
   - OEM repair manuals often leak DIDs and PID mappings.
   - Record a log while actuating something (window switch, indicator) and diff the frames.

## Responsible experimentation

- **Always bench-test first.** Shorting a bus or sending malformed frames can brick an ECU.
- Keep a clean power supply (13.8 V max) and current-limit to 2–3 A.
- Have an OBD service tool (e.g. Autel AP200) on hand to clear DTCs.
- Never probe live airbags or high-voltage EV buses without training and PPE.
- Anything on public roads must comply with local law. Tampering with safety systems is illegal in most jurisdictions.

## Where to go next

| Goal              | Suggested project                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build confidence  | Log CAN traffic and blink a dashboard light by replaying a frame.                                   |
| Add features      | Retrofit a reverse camera; enable hidden OEM functions (e.g. lane-assist).                          |
| Security research | Fuzz UDS services. Beware of permanent DTCs.                                                        |
| Advanced          | Stand up an Ethernet TSN lab with an NXP SJA1105 switch; experiment with SOME/IP service discovery. |
